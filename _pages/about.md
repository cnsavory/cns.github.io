Welcome to my website! I'm Chris Savory, Computational Chemistry Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham. From 2021-2023 I was Ramsay Memorial Research Fellow at the Department of Chemistry at UCL. I'm a computational materials chemist, using ab initio techniques to study materials for sustainable technologies based on renewable energy applications, including photovoltaics, phosphors and Li-ion batteries. Through these techniques we can better understand the materials of today and help to design more efficient, cheaper and sustainable materials for the future.
